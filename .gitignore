# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore changes to spec_helper.rb since it has extra stuff in there
# just for JGG, but students shouldn't be required to use it.
/spec/spec_helper.rb

# Ignore all uploaded data files
/code/managers/*
/code/referees/*
/code

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp
*~
*.swp

# Be sure to keep around this file if it matched earlier
!.gitkeep
